## 25.11

- Deepseek V3 on H100 has an issue when using DeepEP and fails with `RuntimeError: DeepEP error: timeout (dispatch CPU)`.
- MODEL_TFLOP/s/GPU is printed as 0 to stdout for all Hybrid models, such as Nemotron-H 56B.


## 25.09

- **Pretraining DeepSeek in subchannel FP8 precision is not working.** Pretraining DeepSeek with current scaling FP8 is a workaround, but MTP loss does not converge.
